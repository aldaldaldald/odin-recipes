    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cans (400g each) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable broth (or water)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Vegan parmesan or nutritional yeast for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the Aromatics: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes and Herbs: Pour in the crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, dried basil, and oregano. Stir well to combine. If the tomatoes are too acidic, add a teaspoon of sugar.</li>
        <li>Simmer the Soup: Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Season and Blend (Optional): Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper. For a smoother texture, you can blend the soup using an immersion blender or let it cool slightly and blend it in batches in a blender. If you prefer a chunkier texture, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh basil leaves and a sprinkle of vegan parmesan or nutritional yeast, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
